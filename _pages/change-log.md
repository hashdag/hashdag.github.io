I'm constantly tweaking and changing things here. In the spirit of an open redesign, here are my plans and changes. 

## To Do 

- Add node pages to group content beyond tags (i.e. all posts about learning English, all content about meditation) for key content areas.
- Refactor CSS (it's basically spaghetti code ATM). 
- Update content on all static pages (i.e. portfolio, about, uses, etc.).

## Change Log 

**2020.10.31** Added a top bar navigation (Jakob's law and accessibility over asthetics). I also simplified the overall navigation to only 3 top level pages and each subsequent page is within two clicks of the homepage.

**2020.10.25** Contact page merged with about page to help simplify site navigation.

**2020.10.20** Alphabetized the tag page, removed blogroll page.

**2020.10.12** Created the change log page and updated the site map accordingly.
